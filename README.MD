# Welcome to the Angular Show repo

This repo contains the assets to host the Angular Show at ngcruise. 

To run the show, do the following:

```bash

git clone git@github.com:aaronfrost/angularshow.git && cd angularshow

npm install

npm run serve

```

Running the `npm install` command installs the `http-server` and the `purecss` dependencies. 

Running the `http-server` will start a server on [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).


#### This repo should run offline
If you clone and `npm install` before you lose internet connection, this app has no dependencies
on external networks. So you will be good to go.
